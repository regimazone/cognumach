10.8 Device Filter
==================

 -- Function: kern_return_t device_set_filter (device_t DEVICE,
          mach_port_t RECEIVE_PORT,
          mach_msg_type_name_t RECEIVE_PORT_TYPE, int PRIORITY,
          filter_array_t FILTER, mach_msg_type_number_t FILTER_COUNT)
     The function 'device_set_filter' makes it possible to filter out
     selected data arriving at or leaving the device and forward it to a
     port.  FILTER is a list of filter commands, which are applied to
     incoming data to determine if the data should be sent to
     RECEIVE_PORT.  The IPC type of the send right is specified by
     RECEIVE_PORT_RIGHT, it is either 'MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND' or
     'MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND'.  The PRIORITY value is used to order
     multiple filters.

     There can be up to 'NET_MAX_FILTER' commands in FILTER.  The actual
     number of commands is passed in FILTER_COUNT.  For the purpose of
     the filter test, an internal stack is provided.  After all commands
     have been processed, the value on the top of the stack determines
     if the data is forwarded or the next filter is tried.

     The first command is a header which contains two fields: one for
     flags and the other for the type of interpreter used to run the
     rest of the commands.

     Any combination of the following flags is allowed but at least one
     of them must be specified.

     'NETF_IN'
          The filter will be applied to data received by the device.

     'NETF_OUT'
          The filter will be applied to data transmitted by the device.

     Unless the type is given explicitly the native NETF interpreter
     will be used.  To select an alternative implementation use one of
     the following types:

     'NETF_BPF'
          Use Berkeley Packet Filter.

     For the listener to know what kind of packet is being received,
     when the filter code accepts a packet the message sent to
     RECEIVE_PORT is tagged with either NETF_IN or NETF_OUT.

     Each word of the command list specifies a data (push) operation
     (high order NETF_NBPO bits) as well as a binary operator (low order
     NETF_NBPA bits).  The value to be pushed onto the stack is chosen
     as follows.

     'NETF_PUSHLIT'
          Use the next short word of the filter as the value.

     'NETF_PUSHZERO'
          Use 0 as the value.

     'NETF_PUSHWORD+N'
          Use short word N of the "data" portion of the message as the
          value.

     'NETF_PUSHHDR+N'
          Use short word N of the "header" portion of the message as the
          value.

     'NETF_PUSHIND+N'
          Pops the top long word from the stack and then uses short word
          N of the "data" portion of the message as the value.

     'NETF_PUSHHDRIND+N'
          Pops the top long word from the stack and then uses short word
          N of the "header" portion of the message as the value.

     'NETF_PUSHSTK+N'
          Use long word N of the stack (where the top of stack is long
          word 0) as the value.

     'NETF_NOPUSH'
          Don't push a value.

     The unsigned value so chosen is promoted to a long word before
     being pushed.  Once a value is pushed (except for the case of
     'NETF_NOPUSH'), the top two long words of the stack are popped and
     a binary operator applied to them (with the old top of stack as the
     second operand).  The result of the operator is pushed on the
     stack.  These operators are:

     'NETF_NOP'
          Don't pop off any values and do no operation.

     'NETF_EQ'
          Perform an equal comparison.

     'NETF_LT'
          Perform a less than comparison.

     'NETF_LE'
          Perform a less than or equal comparison.

     'NETF_GT'
          Perform a greater than comparison.

     'NETF_GE'
          Perform a greater than or equal comparison.

     'NETF_AND'
          Perform a bitise boolean AND operation.

     'NETF_OR'
          Perform a bitise boolean inclusive OR operation.

     'NETF_XOR'
          Perform a bitise boolean exclusive OR operation.

     'NETF_NEQ'
          Perform a not equal comparison.

     'NETF_LSH'
          Perform a left shift operation.

     'NETF_RSH'
          Perform a right shift operation.

     'NETF_ADD'
          Perform an addition.

     'NETF_SUB'
          Perform a subtraction.

     'NETF_COR'
          Perform an equal comparison.  If the comparison is 'TRUE',
          terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the
          comparison off the stack.

     'NETF_CAND'
          Perform an equal comparison.  If the comparison is 'FALSE',
          terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the
          comparison off the stack.

     'NETF_CNOR'
          Perform a not equal comparison.  If the comparison is 'FALSE',
          terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the
          comparison off the stack.

     'NETF_CNAND'
          Perform a not equal comparison.  If the comparison is 'TRUE',
          terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the
          comparison off the stack.  The scan of the filter list
          terminates when the filter list is emptied, or a 'NETF_C...'
          operation terminates the list.  At this time, if the final
          value of the top of the stack is 'TRUE', then the message is
          accepted for the filter.

     The function returns 'D_SUCCESS' if some data was successfully
     written, 'D_INVALID_OPERATION' if RECEIVE_PORT is not a valid send
     right, and 'D_NO_SUCH_DEVICE' if DEVICE does not denote a device
     port or the device is dead or not completely open.

10.9 Device Interrupt
=====================

 -- Function: kern_return_t device_intr_register (device_t DEVICE,
          int ID, int FLAGS, mach_port_t RECEIVE_PORT)
     The function 'device_intr_register' registers for receiving
     hardware interrupt events through DEVICE_INTR_NOTIFY notifications.
     The hardware interrupt identifier is specified by ID.  FLAGS must
     be set to 0.  The notifications will be sent on the RECEIVE_PORT
     send right.  'device_intr_register' is only available on the
     dedicated 'irq' device.

 -- Function: kern_return_t device_intr_ack (device_t DEVICE,
          mach_port_t RECEIVE_PORT)
     On a hardware interrupt, the kernel disables the interrupt line
     before sending notifications.  To prevent from interrupt losses,
     the interrupt is kept disabled until 'device_intr_ack' is called to
     acknowledge the interrupt.  RECEIVE_PORT is the send right on which
     the interrupt notification was received.

11 Kernel Debugger
******************

The GNU Mach kernel debugger 'ddb' is a powerful built-in debugger with
a gdb like syntax.  It is enabled at compile time using the
'--enable-kdb' option.  Whenever you want to enter the debugger while
running the kernel, you can press the key combination <Ctrl-Alt-D>.

* Menu:

* Operation::                     Basic architecture of the kernel debugger.
* Commands::                      Available commands in the kernel debugger.
* Variables::                     Access of variables from the kernel debugger.
* Expressions::                   Usage of expressions in the kernel debugger.


File: mach.info,  Node: Operation,  Next: Commands,  Up: Kernel Debugger

11.1 Operation
==============

The current location is called "dot".  The dot is displayed with a
hexadecimal format at a prompt.  Examine and write commands update dot
to the address of the last line examined or the last location modified,
and set "next" to the address of the next location to be examined or
changed.  Other commands don't change dot, and set next to be the same
as dot.

   The general command syntax is:

     COMMAND[/MODIFIER] ADDRESS [,COUNT]

   '!!' repeats the previous command, and a blank line repeats from the
address next with count 1 and no modifiers.  Specifying ADDRESS sets dot
to the address.  Omitting ADDRESS uses dot.  A missing COUNT is taken to
be 1 for printing commands or infinity for stack traces.

   Current 'ddb' is enhanced to support multi-thread debugging.  A break
point can be set only for a specific thread, and the address space or
registers of non current thread can be examined or modified if supported
by machine dependent routines.  For example,

     break/t mach_msg_trap $task11.0

   sets a break point at 'mach_msg_trap' for the first thread of task 11
listed by a 'show all threads' command.

   In the above example, '$task11.0' is translated to the corresponding
thread structure's address by variable translation mechanism described
later.  If a default target thread is set in a variable '$thread', the
'$task11.0' can be omitted.  In general, if 't' is specified in a
modifier of a command line, a specified thread or a default target
thread is used as a target thread instead of the current one.  The 't'
modifier in a command line is not valid in evaluating expressions in a
command line.  If you want to get a value indirectly from a specific
thread's address space or access to its registers within an expression,
you have to specify a default target thread in advance, and to use ':t'
modifier immediately after the indirect access or the register reference
like as follows:

     set $thread $task11.0
     print $eax:t *(0x100):tuh

   No sign extension and indirection 'size(long, half word, byte)' can
be specified with 'u', 'l', 'h' and 'b' respectively for the indirect
access.

   Note: Support of non current space/register access and user space
break point depend on the machines.  If not supported, attempts of such
operation may provide incorrect information or may cause strange
behavior.  Even if supported, the user space access is limited to the
pages resident in the main memory at that time.  If a target page is not
in the main memory, an error will be reported.

   'ddb' has a feature like a command 'more' for the output.  If an
output line exceeds the number set in the '$lines' variable, it displays
'--db_more--' and waits for a response.  The valid responses for it are:

'<SPC>'
     one more page

'<RET>'
     one more line

'q'
     abort the current command, and return to the command input mode

11.2 Commands
=============

'examine(x) [/MODIFIER] ADDR[,COUNT] [ THREAD ]'
     Display the addressed locations according to the formats in the
     modifier.  Multiple modifier formats display multiple locations.
     If no format is specified, the last formats specified for this
     command is used.  Address space other than that of the current
     thread can be specified with 't' option in the modifier and THREAD
     parameter.  The format characters are

     'b'
          look at by bytes(8 bits)

     'h'
          look at by half words(16 bits)

     'l'
          look at by long words(32 bits)

     'q'
          look at by quad words(64 bits)

     'a'
          print the location being displayed

     ','
          skip one unit producing no output

     'A'
          print the location with a line number if possible

     'x'
          display in unsigned hex

     'z'
          display in signed hex

     'o'
          display in unsigned octal

     'd'
          display in signed decimal

     'u'
          display in unsigned decimal

     'r'
          display in current radix, signed

     'c'
          display low 8 bits as a character.  Non-printing characters
          are displayed as an octal escape code (e.g.  '\000').

     's'
          display the null-terminated string at the location.
          Non-printing characters are displayed as octal escapes.

     'm'
          display in unsigned hex with character dump at the end of each
          line.  The location is also displayed in hex at the beginning
          of each line.

     'i'
          display as an instruction

     'I'
          display as an instruction with possible alternate formats
          depending on the machine:

          'vax'
               don't assume that each external label is a procedure
               entry mask

          'i386'
               don't round to the next long word boundary

          'mips'
               print register contents

'xf'
     Examine forward.  It executes an examine command with the last
     specified parameters to it except that the next address displayed
     by it is used as the start address.

'xb'
     Examine backward.  It executes an examine command with the last
     specified parameters to it except that the last start address
     subtracted by the size displayed by it is used as the start
     address.

'whatis ADDR'
     Try to find what this address is.  This looks up in the various
     tasks, threads, maps, caches etc.  to give an idea what is behind
     this address.

'print[/axzodurc] ADDR1 [ ADDR2 ... ]'
     Print ADDR's according to the modifier character.  Valid formats
     are: 'a' 'x' 'z' 'o' 'd' 'u' 'r' 'c'.  If no modifier is specified,
     the last one specified to it is used.  ADDR can be a string, and it
     is printed as it is.  For example,

          print/x "eax = " $eax "\necx = " $ecx "\n"

     will print like

          eax = xxxxxx
          ecx = yyyyyy

'write[/bhlt] ADDR [ THREAD ] EXPR1 [ EXPR2 ... ]'
     Write the expressions at succeeding locations.  The write unit size
     can be specified in the modifier with a letter b (byte), h (half
     word) or l(long word) respectively.  If omitted, long word is
     assumed.  Target address space can also be specified with 't'
     option in the modifier and THREAD parameter.  Warning: since there
     is no delimiter between expressions, strange things may happen.
     It's best to enclose each expression in parentheses.

'set $VARIABLE [=] EXPR'
     Set the named variable or register with the value of EXPR.  Valid
     variable names are described below.

'break[/tuTU] ADDR[,COUNT] [ THREAD1 ... ]'
     Set a break point at ADDR.  If count is supplied, continues
     (COUNT-1) times before stopping at the break point.  If the break
     point is set, a break point number is printed with '#'.  This
     number can be used in deleting the break point or adding conditions
     to it.

     't'
          Set a break point only for a specific thread.  The thread is
          specified by THREAD parameter, or default one is used if the
          parameter is omitted.

     'u'
          Set a break point in user space address.  It may be combined
          with 't' or 'T' option to specify the non-current target user
          space.  Without 'u' option, the address is considered in the
          kernel space, and wrong space address is rejected with an
          error message.  This option can be used only if it is
          supported by machine dependent routines.

     'T'
          Set a break point only for threads in a specific task.  It is
          like 't' option except that the break point is valid for all
          threads which belong to the same task as the specified target
          thread.

     'U'
          Set a break point in shared user space address.  It is like
          'u' option, except that the break point is valid for all
          threads which share the same address space even if 't' option
          is specified.  't' option is used only to specify the target
          shared space.  Without 't' option, 'u' and 'U' have the same
          meanings.  'U' is useful for setting a user space break point
          in non-current address space with 't' option such as in an
          emulation library space.  This option can be used only if it
          is supported by machine dependent routines.

     Warning: if a user text is shadowed by a normal user space
     debugger, user space break points may not work correctly.  Setting
     a break point at the low-level code paths may also cause strange
     behavior.

'delete[/tuTU] ADDR|#NUMBER [ THREAD1 ... ]'
     Delete the break point.  The target break point can be specified by
     a break point number with '#', or by ADDR like specified in 'break'
     command.

'cond #NUMBER [ CONDITION COMMANDS ]'
     Set or delete a condition for the break point specified by the
     NUMBER.  If the CONDITION and COMMANDS are null, the condition is
     deleted.  Otherwise the condition is set for it.  When the break
     point is hit, the CONDITION is evaluated.  The COMMANDS will be
     executed if the condition is true and the break point count set by
     a break point command becomes zero.  COMMANDS is a list of commands
     separated by semicolons.  Each command in the list is executed in
     that order, but if a 'continue' command is executed, the command
     execution stops there, and the stopped thread resumes execution.
     If the command execution reaches the end of the list, and it enters
     into a command input mode.  For example,

          set $work0 0
          break/Tu xxx_start $task7.0
          cond #1  (1)  set $work0 1; set $work1 0; cont
          break/T  vm_fault $task7.0
          cond #2  ($work0) set $work1 ($work1+1); cont
          break/Tu xxx_end $task7.0
          cond #3  ($work0) print $work1 " faults\n"; set $work0 0
          cont

     will print page fault counts from 'xxx_start' to 'xxx_end' in
     'task7'.

'step[/p] [,COUNT]'
     Single step COUNT times.  If 'p' option is specified, print each
     instruction at each step.  Otherwise, only print the last
     instruction.

     Warning: depending on machine type, it may not be possible to
     single-step through some low-level code paths or user space code.
     On machines with software-emulated single-stepping (e.g., pmax),
     stepping through code executed by interrupt handlers will probably
     do the wrong thing.

'continue[/c]'
     Continue execution until a breakpoint or watchpoint.  If '/c',
     count instructions while executing.  Some machines (e.g., pmax)
     also count loads and stores.

     Warning: when counting, the debugger is really silently
     single-stepping.  This means that single-stepping on low-level code
     may cause strange behavior.

'until'
     Stop at the next call or return instruction.

'next[/p]'
     Stop at the matching return instruction.  If 'p' option is
     specified, print the call nesting depth and the cumulative
     instruction count at each call or return.  Otherwise, only print
     when the matching return is hit.

'match[/p]'
     A synonym for 'next'.

'trace[/tu] [ FRAME_ADDR|THREAD ][,COUNT]'
     Stack trace.  'u' option traces user space; if omitted, only traces
     kernel space.  If 't' option is specified, it shows the stack trace
     of the specified thread or a default target thread.  Otherwise, it
     shows the stack trace of the current thread from the frame address
     specified by a parameter or from the current frame.  COUNT is the
     number of frames to be traced.  If the COUNT is omitted, all frames
     are printed.

     Warning: If the target thread's stack is not in the main memory at
     that time, the stack trace will fail.  User space stack trace is
     valid only if the machine dependent code supports it.

'search[/bhl] ADDR VALUE [MASK] [,COUNT]'
     Search memory for a value.  This command might fail in interesting
     ways if it doesn't find the searched-for value.  This is because
     'ddb' doesn't always recover from touching bad memory.  The
     optional count argument limits the search.

'macro NAME COMMANDS'
     Define a debugger macro as NAME.  COMMANDS is a list of commands to
     be associated with the macro.  In the expressions of the command
     list, a variable '$argxx' can be used to get a parameter passed to
     the macro.  When a macro is called, each argument is evaluated as
     an expression, and the value is assigned to each parameter,
     '$arg1', '$arg2', ... respectively.  10 '$arg' variables are
     reserved to each level of macros, and they can be used as local
     variables.  The nesting of macro can be allowed up to 5 levels.
     For example,

          macro xinit set $work0 $arg1
          macro xlist examine/m $work0,4; set $work0 *($work0)
          xinit *(xxx_list)
          xlist
          ...

     will print the contents of a list starting from 'xxx_list' by each
     'xlist' command.

'dmacro NAME'
     Delete the macro named NAME.

'show all threads[/uls]'
     Display all tasks and threads information.  This version of 'ddb'
     prints more information than previous one.  It shows UNIX process
     information like 'ps' for each task.  The UNIX process information
     may not be shown if it is not supported in the machine, or the
     bottom of the stack of the target task is not in the main memory at
     that time.  It also shows task and thread identification numbers.
     These numbers can be used to specify a task or a thread
     symbolically in various commands.  The numbers are valid only in
     the same debugger session.  If the execution is resumed again, the
     numbers may change.  The current thread can be distinguished from
     others by a '#' after the thread id instead of ':'.  Without 'l'
     option, it only shows thread id, thread structure address and the
     status for each thread.  The status consists of 6 letters, R(run),
     W(wait), S(suspended), O(swapped out), N(interruptible), and
     F(loating) point arithmetic used (if supported by the platform).
     If the corresponding status bit is off, '.' is printed instead.  If
     'l' option is specified, more detail information is printed for
     each thread.  If the 's' option is given, scheduling information is
     displayed.

'show all tasks'
     Displays all tasks similar to 'show all threads', but omits
     information about the individual threads.

'show task [ ADDR ]'
     Display the information of a task specified by ADDR.  If ADDR is
     omitted, current task information is displayed.

     'show task $taskxx' can notably be used to show task number XX

'show thread [ ADDR ]'
     Display the information of a thread specified by ADDR.  If ADDR is
     omitted, current thread information is displayed.

     'show thread $taskxx.yy' can notably be used to show thread number
     YY of task number XX.

'show registers[/tu [ THREAD ]]'
     Display the register set.  Target thread can be specified with 't'
     option and THREAD parameter.  If 'u' option is specified, it
     displays user registers instead of kernel or currently saved one.

     Warning: The support of 't' and 'u' option depends on the machine.
     If not supported, incorrect information will be displayed.

'show map ADDR'
     Prints the 'vm_map' at ADDR.

     'show map $mapxx' can notably be used to show the map of task
     number XX.

'show object ADDR'
     Prints the 'vm_object' at ADDR.

'show page ADDR'
     Prints the 'vm_page' structure at ADDR.

'show port ADDR'
     Prints the 'ipc_port' structure at ADDR.

'show ipc_port[/t [ THREAD ]]'
     Prints all 'ipc_port' structure's addresses the target thread has.
     The target thread is a current thread or that specified by a
     parameter.

'show macro [ NAME ]'
     Show the definitions of macros.  If NAME is specified, only the
     definition of it is displayed.  Otherwise, definitions of all
     macros are displayed.

'show watches'
     Displays all watchpoints.

'watch[/T] ADDR,SIZE [ TASK ]'
     Set a watchpoint for a region.  Execution stops when an attempt to
     modify the region occurs.  The SIZE argument defaults to 4.
     Without 'T' option, ADDR is assumed to be a kernel address.  If you
     want to set a watch point in user space, specify 'T' and TASK
     parameter where the address belongs to.  If the TASK parameter is
     omitted, a task of the default target thread or a current task is
     assumed.  If you specify a wrong space address, the request is
     rejected with an error message.

     Warning: Attempts to watch wired kernel memory may cause
     unrecoverable error in some systems such as i386.  Watchpoints on
     user addresses work best.

'dwatch[/T] ADDR [ TASK ]'
     Clears a watchpoint previously set for a region.  Without 'T'
     option, ADDR is assumed to be a kernel address.  If you want to
     clear a watch point in user space, specify 'T' and TASK parameter
     where the address belongs to.  If the TASK parameter is omitted, a
     task of the default target thread or a current task is assumed.  If
     you specify a wrong space address, the request is rejected with an
     error message.

'debug traps /on|/off'
     Enables or disables debugging of all traps with 'ddb'.

'debug references /on|/off'
     Enables or disables debugging of all port reference counting errors
     with 'ddb'.

11.3 Variables
==============

The debugger accesses registers and variables as $NAME.  Register names
are as in the 'show registers' command.  Some variables are suffixed
with numbers, and may have some modifier following a colon immediately
after the variable name.  For example, register variables can have 'u'
and 't' modifier to indicate user register and that of a default target
thread instead of that of the current thread (e.g.  '$eax:tu').

   Built-in variables currently supported are:

'taskXX[.YY]'
     Task or thread structure address.  XX and YY are task and thread
     identification numbers printed by a 'show all threads' command
     respectively.  This variable is read only.

'mapXX'
     VM map structure address.  XX is a task identification number
     printed by a 'show all tasks' command.  This variable is read only.

'thread'
     The default target thread.  The value is used when 't' option is
     specified without explicit thread structure address parameter in
     command lines or expression evaluation.

'radix'
     Input and output radix

'maxoff'
     Addresses are printed as SYMBOL+OFFSET unless offset is greater
     than maxoff.

'maxwidth'
     The width of the displayed line.

'lines'
     The number of lines.  It is used by 'more' feature.

'tabstops'
     Tab stop width.

'argXX'
     Parameters passed to a macro.  XX can be 1 to 10.

'workXX'
     Work variable.  XX can be 0 to 31.


File: mach.info,  Node: Expressions,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Kernel Debugger

11.4 Expressions
================

Almost all expression operators in C are supported except '~', '^', and
unary '&'.  Special rules in 'ddb' are:

'IDENTIFIER'
     name of a symbol.  It is translated to the address(or value) of it.
     '.' and ':' can be used in the identifier.  If supported by an
     object format dependent routine, [FILE_NAME:]FUNC[:LINE_NUMBER]
     [FILE_NAME:]VARIABLE, and FILE_NAME[:LINE_NUMBER] can be accepted
     as a symbol.  The symbol may be prefixed with 'SYMBOL_TABLE_NAME::'
     like 'emulator::mach_msg_trap' to specify other than kernel
     symbols.

'NUMBER'
     radix is determined by the first two letters:
     '0x'
          hex
     '0o'
          octal
     '0t'
          decimal

     otherwise, follow current radix.

'.'
     dot

'+'
     next

'..'
     address of the start of the last line examined.  Unlike dot or
     next, this is only changed by 'examine' or 'write' command.

'´'
     last address explicitly specified.

'$VARIABLE'
     register name or variable.  It is translated to the value of it.
     It may be followed by a ':' and modifiers as described above.

'a'
     multiple of right hand side.

'*EXPR'
     indirection.  It may be followed by a ':' and modifiers as
     described above.

GNU General Public License
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===============================================================

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
     Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
          all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
     or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
     on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
     that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
     to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
     herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
     parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
     specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
     the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

  11. NO WARRANTY

     BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
