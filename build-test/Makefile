# TODO.  This file should probably be distributed with GNU MIG and then there
# should be some mechanism so that every package using it is automagically
# using the latest available (or best-matching) version of it.  Which is not
# trivial, as the file is already needed to build the build system.  But then,
# this file does not really depend on GNU Automake.  Hmm...

# USAGE.

# Before `include'ing this file, `noinst_LIBRARIES' and `MOSTLYCLEANFILES' have
# to be initialized.

# For using these rules, `AM_CPPFLAGS', `MIGCOM', `MIGCOMFLAGS', `MIGCOMSFLAGS'
# and `MIGCOMUFLAGS' have to be defined as desired.

# Then you can (read: currently ``have to''; see below for comments) use
# constructs like:
#
# # User stubs.
# nodist_lib_dep_tr_for_defs_a_SOURCES += \
# 	vm/memory_object_user.user.defs.c
# nodist_libkernel_a_SOURCES += \
# 	vm/memory_object_user.user.h \
# 	vm/memory_object_user.user.c \
# 	vm/memory_object_user.user.msgids
#
# # Server stubs.
# nodist_lib_dep_tr_for_defs_a_SOURCES += \
# 	device/device.server.defs.c
# nodist_libkernel_a_SOURCES += \
# 	device/device.server.h \
# 	device/device.server.c \
# 	device/device.server.msgids

#
# Building RPC stubs.
#

# TODO.  Get rid of that stuff, lib_dep_tr_for_defs.a and the four following
# rules.  See the thread at
# <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2006-10/msg00039.html> about what
# we really want to do.  This requires work on GNU Automake.
